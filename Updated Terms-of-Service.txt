In addition, although these Terms require Members to provide accurate information, we do not attempt to confirm, and do not confirm, any Member’s purported identity. You are responsible for determining the identity and suitability of others who you contact via the Site, Application and Services. We will not be responsible for any damage or harm resulting from your interactions with other Members. By using the Site, Application or Services, you agree that any legal remedy or liability that you seek to obtain for actions or omissions of other Members or other third parties will be limited to a claim against the particular Members or other third parties who caused you harm and you agree not to attempt to impose liability on, or seek any legal remedy from Foodopian with respect to such actions or omissions. Accordingly, we encourage you to communicate directly with other Members on the Site and Services regarding any Events.

Events
As a Member, you may create Events. To this end, you will be asked a variety of questions about the Event to be listed, including, but not limited to, the location, capacity, menu, date, and pricing and related rules and financial terms. In order to be featured in Events via the Site, Application and Services, all Event must have valid physical addresses. Events will be made publicly available via the Site, Application and Services. Other Members will be able to book your Event via the Site, Application and Services based upon the information provided in your Event. You understand and agree that once a Guest makes payment for a Host’s Event, the price for such booking may not be altered.
You acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for any and all Events you post. Accordingly, you represent and warrant that any Event you post and the booking of, or Guest attendance at, a Event you post (i) will not breach any agreements you have entered into with any third parties, (ii) will (a) be in compliance with all applicable laws, Tax requirements, and rules and regulations that may apply to any Event included in a Event you post, including, but not limited to, zoning laws, health laws, license laws and any other applicable laws governing properties and food and (b) not conflict with the rights of third parties; and (iii) agree not to invite any persons other than Guests at a Event. Please note that Foodopian assumes no responsibility for a Host’s compliance with any applicable laws, rules and regulations, or a Host’s failure to comply with the aforesaid covenants.
You understand and agree that Foodopian does not act as an insurer or as a contracting agent for, or representative of, you as a Host, and if a Guest requests a booking of your Event and consumes your Event, any agreement you enter into with such Guest is between you and the Guest and Foodopian is not a party thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Foodopian serves as the limited authorized payment collection agent of the Host for the purpose of accepting, on behalf of the Host, payments from Guests of such amounts stipulated by the Host.
Please note that Foodopian reserves the right, at any time and without prior notice, to remove or disable access to any Event for any reason, including Events that Foodopian, in its sole discretion, considers to be objectionable for any reason, in violation of these Terms or otherwise harmful to the Site, Application or Services.
When you create a Event you may also choose to include certain requirements which must be met by the Members who are eligible to request a booking of your Event, including, but not limited to, requiring Members to have a profile picture or verified phone number, in order to book your Event. Any Member wishing to book Events included in Events with such requirements must meet these requirements.
If you are a Host, Foodopian makes certain tools available to you to help you to make informed decisions about which Members you choose to confirm for your Events. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Host, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who reside at or are otherwise present at the Event at your request or invitation.
Foodopian recommends that Hosts obtain appropriate insurance for their Events and Events. Please review any insurance policy that you may have for your Event carefully, and in particular please make sure that you are familiar with and understand any exclusions to, and any deductibles that may apply for, such insurance policy, including, but not limited to, whether or not your insurance policy will cover the actions or inactions of persons (including the Guests and any individuals the Guests invites to the Event, if applicable) while at your Event.
Foodopian is not responsible for purchasing an insurance to protect Hosts. As with any insurance policy, additional insurance terms, limitations, and exclusions apply. We do not procure insurance for, nor are we responsible for, personal belongings left at any location by the Guests. None of the statements in this section should be interpreted as binding and are provided for quick reference only.

Bookings and Financial Terms

Foodopian uses Braintree, a division of PayPal, Inc. (Braintree) for payment processing. In order for you to use Braintree's payment processing services, you must read and agree to the Commercial Entity User Agreement (CEA) available at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/cea-wells and the Payment Services Agreement available at https://www.braintreepayments.com/legal/gateway-agreement. By accepting this Agreement, you agree: (a) that you have downloaded or printed the CEA, and (b) that you have reviewed and agree to the CEA. If you have questions regarding the CEA or the PSA, please contact Braintree at 877.434.2894.

Once Guests place order and make payment, Foodopian will send both involved parties (Host & Guest) an email, text message and message via the Application confirming such booking, depending on the selections you make via the Site, Application and Services. 
The fees displayed in each Event are comprised of the Event Fees (defined below) and the Service Fees. Where applicable, Taxes may be charged in addition to the Event Fees and Service Fees. The Event Fees, the Service Fees and applicable Taxes are collectively referred to in these Terms as the "Total Fees". The amounts due and payable by a Guest solely relating to a Host’s Event are the "Event Fees". Please note that it is the Host and not Foodopian which determines the Event Fees. Each Host hereby appoints Foodopian as the Host’s limited payment collection agent solely for the purpose of accepting the Event Fees from Guests.
The Hosts, not Foodopian, are solely responsible for honoring any confirmed bookings and making available any Events reserved through the Site, Application and Services. If you, as a Guest, choose to enter into a transaction with a Host for the booking of a Event, you agree and understand that you will be required to enter into an agreement with the Host and you agree to accept any terms, conditions, rules and restrictions associated with such Event imposed by the Host. You acknowledge and agree that you, and not Foodopian, will be responsible for performing the obligations of any such agreements, and Foodopian is not a party to such agreements and disclaims all liability arising from or related to any such agreements.
You agree to pay Foodopian for the Total Fees (Event Fees, Service Fees, and Tax) for any order confirmed in connection with your Foodopian. In order to establish a confirmation of your confirmed order, you understand and agree that Foodopian reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to (i) obtain a pre-authorization via your payment method for the Total Fees or (ii) charge your payment method a nominal amount, not to exceed one dollar ($1), or a similar sum in the currency in which you are transacting (e.g. one euro or one British pound) to verify your payment method. Once Foodopian receives confirmation of your booking from the applicable Host, Foodopian will collect the Total Fees in accordance with the terms and conditions of these Terms and the pricing terms set forth in the applicable Event. Please note that Foodopian cannot control any fees that may be charged to a Guest by his or her bank related to Foodopian’s collection of the Total Fees, and Foodopian disclaims all liability in this regard.
In connection with your placed order, you will be asked to provide customary billing information such as name, billing address and payment method information either to Foodopian or its third party payment processor. You agree to pay Foodopian for any confirmed bookings made in connection with your Foodopian Account in accordance with these Terms by one of the methods described on the Site or Application – e.g. by debit or credit card. You hereby authorize the collection of such amounts by charging the payment method provided as part of requesting the booking, either directly by Foodopian or indirectly, via a third party online payment processor or by one of the payment methods described on the Site or Application. If you are directed to Foodopian’s third party payment processor, you may be subject to terms and conditions governing use of that third party’s service and that third party’s personal information collection practices. Please review such terms and conditions and privacy policy before using the services. Once your confirmed order transaction is complete you will receive a confirmation email summarizing your confirmed order.
EACH PAYABLE TRANACTION OF ORDER TO HOSTS WILL BE PROCESSED IMMEDIATELY AFTER MIDNIGHT ON THE SECOND DAY OF THE Event DATE ACCORDINGLY.

Service Fees

In consideration for providing the Services, Foodopian collects five percent (5%) service fees from each transaction ("Service Fees"). Where applicable, Taxes may also be charged in addition to the Service Fees. Service Fees are deducted from the Event Fees before remitting the Event Fees to the Host. 
Balances will be remitted to Hosts via PayPal, direct deposit or other payment methods described on the Site or via the Application, in the Host’s currency of choice, depending upon the selections the Host makes via the Site, Application and Services. Please note that for any payments by Foodopian in currencies other than U.S. dollars, Foodopian may deduct foreign currency processing costs from such payments. Except as otherwise provided herein, Service Fees are non-refundable.

Cancellations and Refunds

Once Guests place order and make payment, the order cannot be canceled by both parties (Host & Guest) within 24 hours before the appointed event time. Please contact the Foodopian team for cancellation and refunds (email: info@foodopian.com). Both Guest and Host involved in an upcoming event have right to cancel the order. Foodopian reserves the right to charge Service Fees (defined below) no matter the order is canceled or not, and the rest of payment will be refunded to the one who pays. The transaction process will start once Foodpian finishes processing the cancellation request. The party (Host or Guest) who cancels order is responsible for paying Foodopian Service Fees. 
Payment Processing Errors
We will take steps to rectify any payment processing errors that we become aware of. These steps may include crediting or debiting (as appropriate) the same payment method used for the original payout to or payment by you, so that you end up receiving or paying the correct amount.
Damage to Event Location

As a Guest, you are responsible for treating the location in which the Event is served in a respectful manner. You acknowledge and agree that, as a Guest, you are responsible for your own acts and omissions and are also responsible for the acts and omissions of any individuals who you invite to, or otherwise provide access to, the Event. In the event that a Host claims otherwise and provides evidence of damage, including but not limited to, photographs, you agree to pay the cost of replacing the damaged items with equivalent items. After being notified of the claim and given forty eight (48) hours to respond, Foodopian shall, on behalf of the Host, charge the payment to the credit card on file in your Foodopian Account, and you and the Host expressly authorize Foodopian to do so. Host also authorizes Foodopian to charge the payment method on file in your Foodopian Account, or otherwise collect payment from you and pursue any avenues available to Foodopian in this regard, in situations in which you have been determined to have damaged any Event Location, including, but not limited to, in relation to any payment requests made by Hosts, and in relation to any payments made by Foodopian to Hosts. If we are unable to charge the credit card on file or otherwise collect payment from you, you agree to remit payment for any damage to the Event Location to the applicable Host or to Foodopian (if applicable).
Both Guests and Hosts agree to cooperate with and assist Foodopian in good faith, and to provide Foodopian with such information and take such actions as may be reasonably requested by Foodopian, in connection with any complaints or claims made by Members relating to Events or any personal or other property located at a Event Location or food delivery and/or pick up process or with respect to any investigation undertaken by Foodopian or a representative of Foodopian regarding use or abuse of the Site, Application or the Services. If you are a Guest, to the extent you are reasonably able to do so, you agree to participate in mediation or similar resolution process with a Host, at no cost to you, which process will be conducted by Foodopian or a third party selected by Foodopian, with respect to losses for which the Host is requesting payment.
If you are a Guest, you understand and agree that Foodopian or a Host reserves the right, in any of their sole discretion, to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy related to any damage or loss that you may have caused or been responsible for to a Event Location or any personal or other property located at a Event Location. You agree to cooperate with and assist Foodopian in good faith, and to provide Foodopian with such information as may be reasonably requested by Foodopian in order to make a claim under your homeowner’s, renter’s or other insurance policy, including, but not limited to, executing documents and taking such further acts as Foodopian may reasonably request to assist Foodopian in accomplishing the foregoing.
